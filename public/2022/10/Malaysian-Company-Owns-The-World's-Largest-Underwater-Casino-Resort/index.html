        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Malaysian-Company-Owns-The-World’s-Largest-Underwater-Casino-Resort"><a href="#Malaysian-Company-Owns-The-World’s-Largest-Underwater-Casino-Resort" class="headerlink" title="Malaysian Company Owns The World’s Largest Underwater Casino Resort"></a>Malaysian Company Owns The World’s Largest Underwater Casino Resort</h1><p>It was recently announced that a Malaysian company has become the proud owner of the world’s largest underwater casino resort. This new development, which is located in the Philippines, is sure to attract visitors from all over the globe, who are looking for an unique and exciting vacation experience.</p>
<p>The new casino resort is called “The Floating City,” and it features a series of luxury hotels, restaurants, and bars that are all located on a series of man-made islands. The centerpiece of the complex is a massive casino, which spans several levels and offers breathtaking ocean views. There is also a variety of water sports and other activities available for guests to enjoy.</p>
<p>Those who are interested in reserving a room at The Floating City can do so online, or by calling one of the friendly customer service representatives. Room rates start at just $200 per night, making this an affordable option for those who are looking to enjoy some quality time in paradise.</p>
<p>In addition to its new casino resort, the Malaysian company has also announced plans to build a number of other resorts around the world. These include a ski resort in Japan, a beach resort in Spain, and an entertainment complex in Dubai. It seems that this company is determined to become the premier provider of luxury vacations for people from all corners of the globe.</p>
<h1 id="The-Casino-Resort-That’s-So-Big-It’s-Underwater"><a href="#The-Casino-Resort-That’s-So-Big-It’s-Underwater" class="headerlink" title="The Casino Resort That’s So Big It’s Underwater"></a>The Casino Resort That’s So Big It’s Underwater</h1><p>The Mediterranean Sea is the perfect place for a casino resort. It’s光 and clear blue waters make it a desirable destination for vacationers, and its strategic location makes it easy to get to from anywhere in Europe. Marseille is one of the largest cities in France, and it has long been a favorite destination for tourists. The city has a rich history and culture, and it also boasts a vibrant nightlife.</p>
<p>Now Marseille is getting a new attraction: the world’s largest underwater casino resort. The $2.5 billion complex will be built on reclaimed land next to the city’s main port. It will include a hotel, shops, restaurants, and of course, a casino. But what makes this resort really unique is that part of it will be built underwater.</p>
<p>The developers say that the resort will be “a world-class tourist destination that offers something truly unique.” They are betting that the novelty of an underwater casino will be enough to draw visitors from all over the world. And they may be right; casinos are always popular attractions, and there is nothing quite like gambling in a beautiful setting like the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>The developers are hoping to open the resort in 2020. In the meantime, they are busy preparing for construction. This includes dredging sand from the seabed to create an artificial island that will house the casino resort. The project is expected to create 4,000 jobs and bring millions of tourists to Marseille each year.</p>
<h1 id="Mysterious-Malaysian-Company-Owns-Controversial-Underwater-Casino-Resort"><a href="#Mysterious-Malaysian-Company-Owns-Controversial-Underwater-Casino-Resort" class="headerlink" title="Mysterious Malaysian Company Owns Controversial Underwater Casino Resort"></a>Mysterious Malaysian Company Owns Controversial Underwater Casino Resort</h1><p>A Malaysian company owns a controversial underwater casino resort in the Philippines, according to a report by the Philippine Daily Inquirer. The company, PBWC Corporation, has not been forthcoming about its ownership or operations.</p>
<p>The casino resort, which is located in the waters off the island of Palawan, has been criticized for its environmental impacts. The project includes the construction of a large artificial island, as well as a casino, hotel, and shopping mall.</p>
<p>PBWC Corporation has refused to comment on its ownership or operations. However, documents obtained by the Philippine Daily Inquirer suggest that the company is owned by a Malaysian businessman named Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah.</p>
<p>Hamzah is a prominent businessman and former politician in Malaysia. He served as Minister of Finance and Minister of International Trade and Industry in the 1970s and 1980s. He is also the chairman of state-owned investment firm Khazanah Nasional Berhad.</p>
<p>Hamzah has denied owning PBWC Corporation. However, he did say that he is interested in developing the casino resort.</p>
<p>The casino resort has been met with opposition from local residents and environmentalists. They argue that the project will have negative impacts on the environment and local fisheries. They also claim that the jobs created by the project will be low-paying and non-existent once construction is completed.</p>
<h1 id="Controversial-Underwater-Casino-Resort-Owned-By-Malaysian-Firm"><a href="#Controversial-Underwater-Casino-Resort-Owned-By-Malaysian-Firm" class="headerlink" title="Controversial Underwater Casino Resort Owned By Malaysian Firm"></a>Controversial Underwater Casino Resort Owned By Malaysian Firm</h1><p>The development of an underwater casino resort in the Philippines has been met with criticism by some environmental groups who are concerned about the impact on marine life. However, the Malaysian firm behind the project says that it will be a world-class destination that will boost tourism in the area.</p>
<p>The $1.5 billion resort is being built by Genting Malaysia Berhad, which is owned by the country’s richest man, Lim Kok Thay. The project is expected to create 5,000 jobs and bring in an extra $2 billion per year to the local economy.</p>
<p>Genting Malaysia Berhad has already announced plans to build a similar resort in Dubai, which is due to open in 2020. The company says that both resorts will be “jewels in the crown” of its global portfolio of properties.</p>
<p>Critics of the project say that it will damage coral reefs and sea life in the area. They argue that the construction process will release toxic chemicals into the water, and that the bright lights from the casino will attract fish away from their natural habitats.</p>
<p>However, Genting Malaysia Berhad insists that its resorts will be built to high environmental standards, and that they will use cutting-edge technology to minimize their impact on marine life. The company has also promised to fund conservation projects in the area.</p>
<h1 id="Who-Owns-The-Controversial-Underwater-Casino-Resort"><a href="#Who-Owns-The-Controversial-Underwater-Casino-Resort" class="headerlink" title="Who Owns The Controversial Underwater Casino Resort?"></a>Who Owns The Controversial Underwater Casino Resort?</h1><p>The litigation around the building of the casino resort on Palawan has come to a head, with the Court of Appeals dismissing the petition of the environment group Kalikasan PNE to stop the project. The group has now said that they will be taking their case to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>According to reports, the group is arguing that the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) erred in allowing Hong Kong-based Galaxy Entertainment Group to build the $500 million casino complex on a protected area. They are also stating that the environmental impact study (EIS) was not conducted properly.</p>
<p>In response, DENR has said that they followed all of the necessary steps in approving the project and that an EIS was not required because it fell under an exemption for tourism projects.</p>
<p>Environmental groups have been fighting against the casino since it was first proposed, saying that it would damage one of the most pristine areas in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>However, proponents of the project argue that it will bring much-needed jobs and tourism dollars to Palawan. They also say that Galaxy Entertainment Group has made a number of commitments to protect the environment around the resort.</p>
