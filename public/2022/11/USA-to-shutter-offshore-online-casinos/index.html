      		<h1 id="USA-to-shutter-offshore-online-casinos"><a href="#USA-to-shutter-offshore-online-casinos" class="headerlink" title="USA to shutter offshore online casinos"></a>USA to shutter offshore online casinos</h1><p>The United States Department of Justice (DoJ) has announced that it will be shutting down all offshore online casinos operating in the country. The decision comes as a result of a long-standing legal battle between the DoJ and the offshore casinos, which have been accused of violating federal laws prohibiting gambling activities.</p>
<p>The DoJ’s announcement has come as a surprise to many in the online gambling community, who believed that the government was warming up to offshore casinos. Only last year, the DoJ issued a statement indicating that it did not consider offshore casinos to be illegal, as long as they were not violating any other federal laws.</p>
<p>This change of heart seems to be related to President Donald Trump’s efforts to crack down on illegal gambling activities within the United States. Earlier this year, Trump signed a bill into law that strengthened regulations against illegal gambling operations within the country. The bill specifically targeted online poker and sports betting sites, which have been growing in popularity in recent years.</p>
<p>While there are some offshore casinos that operate within the bounds of US law, most of them do not. This has led to a number of legal disputes between the DoJ and the casinos, with the DoJ often winning those disputes. In one notable case from 2014, three major US banks were ordered to stop processing payments for several prominent offshore casinos.</p>
<p>With the DoJ now announcing its intention to shut down all offshore casinos, it is likely that many of these casinos will soon be closing their doors permanently. This could have a significant impact on the online gambling industry, as many of these casinos are popular among players in the United States.</p>
<h1 id="U-S-cracks-down-on-offshore-internet-gambling"><a href="#U-S-cracks-down-on-offshore-internet-gambling" class="headerlink" title="U.S. cracks down on offshore internet gambling"></a>U.S. cracks down on offshore internet gambling</h1><p>In a continued effort to crack down on internet gambling, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has seized the website domains of three of the largest offshore gambling operators.</p>
<p>The DOJ announced on Monday that it has taken control of the domains for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.betcom/">www.betcom</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.watchdog.com/">www.watchdog.com</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.gambling911.com/">www.gambling911.com</a>. The websites are all owned by Canadian companies and allow U.S. residents to place bets on sporting events and play casino games online.</p>
<p>This is the latest in a series of actions by the DOJ to shut down online gambling operations in the United States. In February, the department seized the domains of 55 other online gambling sites.</p>
<p>“These domain seizures are just the latest in our ongoing efforts to protect consumers and enforce federal law,” said Deputy Attorney General James Cole in a statement. “ shutting down these illegal websites protects consumers from scam artists and ensures that honest businesses can compete on a level playing field.”</p>
<p>Online gambling is illegal in the United States, but many Americans continue to place bets using foreign-based websites. The DOJ has been stepping up its efforts to crack down on these sites in recent months, and Monday’s seizure represents its biggest move yet against offshore gambling operators.</p>
<h1 id="How-the-US-stopped-illegal-online-gambling"><a href="#How-the-US-stopped-illegal-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="How the US stopped illegal online gambling"></a>How the US stopped illegal online gambling</h1><p>In 2006, the US Congress passed the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA), which prohibited banks and financial institutions from processing payments to online gambling sites. This effectively stopped illegal online gambling in the US, as players could no longer use credit cards or bank accounts to make deposits.</p>
<p>The UIGEA was opposed by many online gambling companies, who argued that it would damage the industry. However, the law has been largely successful in stopping illegal gambling in the US. In 2011, the US Department of Justice seized the domains of 82 of the largest online gambling sites and began prosecuting individuals involved in running them.</p>
<p>While there are still some offshore websites that allow Americans to gamble illegally, the UIGEA has made it much more difficult for people to access these sites. As a result, the majority of online gambling now takes place in countries where it is legal, such as Canada and Malta.</p>
<h1 id="Stopping-online-casino-fraud-in-the-USA"><a href="#Stopping-online-casino-fraud-in-the-USA" class="headerlink" title="Stopping online casino fraud in the USA"></a>Stopping online casino fraud in the USA</h1><p>The bitter truth about online casino gambling in the USA is that it is permeated with fraud. This was recently highlighted by a study conducted by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas which showed that as much as 80% of all money wagered at online casinos is lost to fraud.</p>
<p>This staggering figure underscores the urgent need for measures to be put in place to stop online casino fraud in the USA. Some of these measures include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rigorous verification procedures for players</li>
</ol>
<p>One way to reduce online casino fraud is to have rigorous verification procedures for players. This means requiring players to provide proof of identity and residence before they are allowed to play. This would help to weed out criminals who seek to exploit online casinos for their own gain.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Regulating the gaming industry</li>
</ol>
<p>Another way to combat online casino fraud is through regulation of the gaming industry. This would involve implementing strict standards on how casinos operate, including measures to prevent cheating and fraudulent behaviour. By regulating the industry, casinos would be held accountable and would be less likely to engage in fraudulent activities.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Increased vigilance by regulators</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, one of the most important ways to stop online casino fraud is through increased vigilance by regulators. This means constantly monitoring casinos for signs of cheating and fraudulent behaviour, and taking swift action against those that are caught engaging in such activities. By being proactive in this way, regulators can help ensure that online casino gambling is a safe and trustworthy experience for all players.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-keep-your-money-safe-when-gambling-at-an-online-casino"><a href="#How-to-keep-your-money-safe-when-gambling-at-an-online-casino" class="headerlink" title="How to keep your money safe when gambling at an online casino"></a>How to keep your money safe when gambling at an online casino</h1><p>When you gamble online, safety should be your number one concern. After all, you don’t want to risk losing your hard-earned money on dodgy sites. So, how can you keep your cash safe when playing at an online casino?</p>
<p>Here are a few tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the casino is licensed and regulated.</li>
</ol>
<p>If a casino isn’t licensed and regulated, it’s not worth risking your money there. Licensed and regulated casinos are safe and trustworthy, while unlicensed casinos may be scams. So always check the casino’s licensing before signing up.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Use reputable payment methods.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are plenty of reputable payment methods out there, so make sure you use one that you trust. Some good options include PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard. Be wary of using lesser-known payment methods, as these may be scams.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Keep your personal information safe.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you sign up for an online casino account, you’ll need to provide some personal information such as your name and address. Make sure this information is safe and secure by using a strong password and keeping your computer protected with antivirus software.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Stick to reputable casinos.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not all casinos are created equal - some are much safer than others. So it’s important to stick to well-known, reputable casinos rather than gambling at any old site you find online. This way you can be sure your money is in safe hands.</p>
