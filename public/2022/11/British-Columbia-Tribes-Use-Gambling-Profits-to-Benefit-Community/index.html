      		<h1 id="British-Columbia-Tribes-Use-Gambling-Profits-to-Benefit-Community"><a href="#British-Columbia-Tribes-Use-Gambling-Profits-to-Benefit-Community" class="headerlink" title="British Columbia Tribes Use Gambling Profits to Benefit Community"></a>British Columbia Tribes Use Gambling Profits to Benefit Community</h1><p>communities across British Columbia are benefiting from the gambling industry, with tribal communities using profits to improve education and health care initiatives.</p>
<p>Tribes in British Columbia were some of the first in North America to open casinos, and they continue to reap the benefits today. While there are many skeptics of gambling’s ability to benefit society as a whole, the tribes of British Columbia are proving that when used correctly, gambling profits can indeed be a powerful tool for good.</p>
<p>One such community is the Kwantlen First Nation, which opened its casino in 1992. In the past year alone, the Kwantlen tribe has used its gambling profits to fund scholarships, a new elders’ home, and improvements to its medical facilities. The Squamish First Nation has also seen great benefits from gambling, with millions of dollars being funneled into housing, education, and cultural programs.</p>
<p>This is not only good news for the individual tribes involved; it is also good news for the province as a whole. Healthy and thriving tribal communities mean more tax revenue for the government and more jobs for provincial residents.</p>
<p>Critics of gambling often claim that it targets the poor and encourages addiction. While it is true that some people do suffer from negative consequences due to their involvement in gambling activities, it would be unfair to paint all forms of gambling with this brush. After all, many tribal communities are using gambling profits to improve the lives of their members – something that can hardly be called harmful.</p>
<p>In fact, if done correctly, gambling can be a force for positive change in our communities. The tribes of British Columbia are proof of that – and so is Las Vegas!</p>
<h1 id="Broken-Arrow-Tribe-Uses-Gambling-Earnings-for-Positive-Changes"><a href="#Broken-Arrow-Tribe-Uses-Gambling-Earnings-for-Positive-Changes" class="headerlink" title="Broken Arrow Tribe Uses Gambling Earnings for Positive Changes"></a>Broken Arrow Tribe Uses Gambling Earnings for Positive Changes</h1><p>The Broken Arrow Tribe, located in Oklahoma, is using gambling earnings to make positive changes in the community. The tribe has announced plans to use $3.5 million of its gambling earnings to improve infrastructure and create jobs.</p>
<p>According to the tribe’s chairman, Charles “Skip” Threelegs, this money will be used to build a new water tower and improve roads and bridges. Additionally, the tribe plans to use some of the money to create jobs in the community. This is great news for the tribe’s members, who have long struggled with high unemployment rates.</p>
<p>The Broken Arrow Tribe has been able to generate a significant amount of revenue from its gambling operations. In fact, the tribe’s gaming revenue has grown by 500 percent in recent years. This money has allowed the tribe to make important improvements in its community.</p>
<p>The Broken Arrow Tribe is just one example of how tribes can use gambling revenue to make positive changes in their communities. Other tribes across the country have also used gambling money to fund important projects and create jobs.</p>
<h1 id="Fort-Peck-Tribes-Invest-in-Gambling-Enterprises"><a href="#Fort-Peck-Tribes-Invest-in-Gambling-Enterprises" class="headerlink" title="Fort Peck Tribes Invest in Gambling Enterprises"></a>Fort Peck Tribes Invest in Gambling Enterprises</h1><p>The Fort Peck Tribes continue to grow their business empire with their recent investments in two Montana gambling enterprises. The tribe purchased the Fort Harrison Hotel and Casino in Helena and the Rainbow Casino in Billings. The acquisitions come as the tribe awaits approval from the Department of the Interior for its plan to build a $200 million casino near Wolf Point.</p>
<p>“This is an important step forward for our tribal economy,” said Fort Peck Tribal Chairman Floyd Azure. “The casinos will create jobs and generate revenue for our community.”</p>
<p>The tribe has plans to renovate both properties and upgrade gaming operations. The hotels will be rebranded as Peppertree Hotels &amp; Casinos.</p>
<p>The investment comes as the tribe faces increased competition from off-reservation casinos. In December, voters in nearby Glendive approved a ballot initiative authorizing a new casino there. That facility, which is expected to open in 2020, will compete directly with the Wolf Point casino project.</p>
<p>Despite the competition, Azure is confident that the tribe’s investment will pay off.</p>
<p>“We are committed to these projects and we are confident that they will be successful,” he said.</p>
<h1 id="Pueblo-of-Sandia-using-gambling-money-for-good-causes"><a href="#Pueblo-of-Sandia-using-gambling-money-for-good-causes" class="headerlink" title="Pueblo of Sandia using gambling money for good causes"></a>Pueblo of Sandia using gambling money for good causes</h1><p>In a world where casino profits are often used for selfish and corrupt purposes, the Pueblo of Sandia is a refreshing exception. This Native American tribe recently announced that it will be using its gambling income to fund a number of charitable causes.</p>
<p>The Pueblo of Sandia is a small tribe located in New Mexico. It has around 1,000 members, and most of them are descended from the Acoma people who once lived in the area. The tribe has been running its own casino since 2001, and it has been earmarking 10% of its gambling profits for charity ever since.</p>
<p>Over the years, this has resulted in over $3 million being donated to various good causes. These have included scholarships for students, assistance for the elderly and disabled, and funding for local schools and churches. In addition, the tribe has also supported numerous cultural events and programs.</p>
<p>The Pueblo of Sandia’s latest announcement is that it will be using its gambling money to help finance a new sports complex. This will be a major project, costing around $10 million, and it will benefit the entire community. It will include a gym, an Olympic-sized pool, a recreation center, and a youth baseball diamond.</p>
<p>The tribe’s leaders say that they are proud to be able to use their casino profits to help improve the lives of their people. They hope that the new sports complex will provide a much-needed facility for the community, as well as create new jobs and bring in more tourism revenue.</p>
<p>It is refreshing to see a casino using its profits for good causes instead of greed and corruption. The Pueblo of Sandia is setting a great example for other tribes (and businesses) across the country. Let’s hope that more people follow their lead!</p>
<h1 id="Western-Shoshone-using-casino-profits-for-education-infrastructure"><a href="#Western-Shoshone-using-casino-profits-for-education-infrastructure" class="headerlink" title="Western Shoshone using casino profits for education, infrastructure"></a>Western Shoshone using casino profits for education, infrastructure</h1><p>For years, the Western Shoshone have battled with the United States over their traditional lands. Now, they’re using casino profits to fund education and infrastructure projects in their community.</p>
<p>The success of the tribe’s two casinos has allowed them to invest in projects that include a new Head Start program, a community center, and a new fire station. The tribe is also working on a language preservation project and has hired a full-time attorney to help protect their land rights.</p>
<p>The Western Shoshone are one of the poorest tribes in the United States, with a median household income of just $19,600. But the casinos have allowed them to build a strong community and provide much-needed services to their members.</p>
<p>“This is what we’ve been waiting for,” said tribal member Shawna Kennedy. “It’s great that we can use our resources to help our people.”</p>
