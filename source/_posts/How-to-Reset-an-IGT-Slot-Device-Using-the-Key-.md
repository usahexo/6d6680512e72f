If you are an avid slot player, you likely know that many of the popular games available require the use of a key. This metal or plastic key is inserted into a hole on the front of the machine, and it is used to lock the reels in place while the game plays. Players can also use the key to spin the reels manually if they choose.

If you are new to slot gaming, or if you have never used a key before, you may be wondering how to use it properly. Here is a guide on how to use the key on IGT slot devices:

1. Locate the keyhole on the front of the machine. This is usually a small hole in the center of the front of the machine.

3. Begin playing your game as normal. The reels will not move until you unlock them with the key.

4. To unlock the reels, insert the key into the hole and turn it counterclockwise until it unlocks. You will know that it has unlocked correctly when you can turn it freely again.

5. Continue playing your game as normal. Remember to lock the reels in place again when your game is over!
