#  Parx Casino Worker Allegedly Robs Slot Machine

A worker at the Parx Casino in Bensalem, Pennsylvania has been accused of robbing a slot machine. Police say that the man, who is employed as a dealer, allegedly stole over $2,000 from the machine.

According to investigators, the incident took place on January 9th. Surveillance footage from the casino shows the dealer reaching into the machine and removing cash. The suspect then reportedly placed the money into his pocket and walked away.

Police have not yet released the name of the suspect, but say that he is cooperating with investigators. He has been charged with theft and related offenses.

This is not the first time that a worker at the Parx Casino has been accused of stealing from a slot machine. In 2016, two dealers were caught on camera stealing over $10,000 from machines at the casino.

#  Parx Casino Dealer Charged with Theft

The Pennsylvania State Police have announced the arrest of a Parx Casino dealer, 42-year-old Karl Korman, on charges of theft. According to the police, Korman is accused of stealing $6,000 from the casino between February and April of this year.

Korman was arraigned before Magisterial District Judge James DeAngelo, who set bail at $10,000 unsecured. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for July 10.

A spokesperson for Parx Casino released a statement commenting on the arrest. "We are aware of the situation and are cooperating with law enforcement," said the spokesperson. "The safety and security of our guests and team members is always our top priority."

This is not the first time that a casino employee in Pennsylvania has been arrested on theft charges. In March, a 41-year-old woman who worked as a slot attendant at Valley Forge Casino Resort was arrested for stealing more than $17,000 from the casino.

#  Parx Casino Slots Technician Arrested for Theft

Police in Bensalem, Pennsylvania have arrested a casino slots technician for theft.

According to authorities, the technician was caught on video stealing money from several slots machines.

She has been charged with felony theft and is currently being held on $50,000 bail.

This is not the first time that a casino technician has been arrested for theft.

In 2016, a technician at the Foxwoods Resort Casino was caught on video stealing nearly $200,000 from slot machines.

He was sentenced to two years in prison.

There have also been several cases of casino employees cheating customers out of their winnings.

In 2012, a blackjack dealer at the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa was caught conspiring with another employee to cheat customers out of over $1 million.

And in 2015, two employees at the Tropicana Casino and Resort were caught manipulating slot machines to create jackpots worth thousands of dollars.

So why do casino employees seem to be so prone to theft?
The answer may be simple: because they can get away with it.

Casino security is notoriously lax, and employees know that they are unlikely to be caught if they steal from the machines or from customers.


#  Parx Casino Workers Accused of Theft

A spokesperson for Parx Casino said that the company is cooperating with law enforcement officials in their investigation.

#  How Many Hours Do a Day Does a Blackjack Dealer Work at Parx Casino?

There is no definitive answer to this question as blackjack dealers at Parx Casino can work any number of hours per day. Some dealers may work 8-hour shifts, while others may work 10 or 12-hour shifts. It really depends on the dealerâ€™s schedule and the needs of the casino. Generally, blackjack dealers are allowed a break every few hours, so they can get up and move around.
