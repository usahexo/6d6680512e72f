#  What is the legal name of the company?

The legal name of a company can be found by looking at the articles of incorporation or certificate of organization. This document will list the company's official name and is filed with the state government.

A company's name is important for many reasons. It is how the company is identified to the public and it is also used on most business documents. The name must be distinguishable from other businesses and it cannot contain any restricted words or phrases.

There are some restrictions on company names in certain states. For example, California does not allow companies to use "corporation," "incorporate," or "limited" in their name unless they are authorized to do so. Additionally, some states have regulations that require companies to include specific information in their name, such as the word "company" or the state's abbreviation.

Choosing a company's legal name is an important task and should be done with care. The name should be something that represents the company well and can be easily remembered by customers and clients.
