#  What does the line mean in activities betting? Learn how to read sports lines and odds to increase your chances of winning.2. How To: Read The Line In Activities Betting
The line in activities betting means the point spread. The factor by which the oddsmaker thinks the two teams playing will differ in score. This line changes constantly based on how much cash wagered is being put down on each side of the game.

In activities betting, you are not betting on who will win or lose. You are betting on by how many points they will win or lose by. This is why there is usually a point spread or line associated with any given match-up.  If you think Team A will beat Team B by more than the line indicates, then you bet on Team A. If you think Team A will lose to Team B by less than the line indicates, then you bet on Team B.

The key to reading sports lines and odds effectively is to understand how - and why - these numbers move around. We'll give you a few examples of what to look for when handicapping games so that you can make smarter bets and increase your chances of winning. 

Example 1: Let's say the line in tonight's NBA game is Miami Heat -4 points against the Milwaukee Bucks. What this means is that the oddsmakers believe that Miami will beat Milwaukee by 4 points or more. If you think that Miami will win by 5 or more points, then you would wager on them to cover the spread. Conversely, if you think that Milwaukee will upset Miami and win by 4 points or more, then you would bet on them to cover the spread as well (or simply place a regular bet on Milwaukee).

Example 2: The Denver Broncos opened as 3-point favorites against the San Diego Chargers in this weekend's NFL matchup. This means that Denver was expected to beat San Diego by at least 3 points - but as we all know, things can change quickly in football games. If early money comes in on San Diego (causing the line to shift), then it would be smart for someone thinking they had a lock on Denver to hedged their bet (bet against Denver) to ensure they at least break even. 
But if someone wanted to take advantage of this potential swing and bet against San Diego when they were initially underdogs, they could do so knowing that their risk is lower since now San Diego would have to upset Denver by quite a bit for them to lose money.

As you can see, reading sports lines and odds takes some knowledge and understanding of how these numbers move around - otherwise it can be tough sledding trying to make any money gambling on games! But with a little practice and these tips under your belt, we're sure you'll start crushing it at the sportsbook!

What is the line, you might ask? In very simple terms, the line refers to the point spread or margin of victory in a given matchup. Bettors will look at this number and then decide whether they believe that one team is going to win by more or less than the number listed. If you think that Team A is going to beat Team B by more than the line, then you would bet on Team A - giving them what's called a "point spread" bet. Conversely, if you think that Team B will beat Team A by more than the line, then you would bet on Team B - also known as a "moneyline" bet.
