There are many different ways to bet on sporting events, but Yes Bet 88 offers some of the simplest and most common types. The main types of bets you can place are:
1) Single or straight bets - these are wagers placed on a single event, such as who will win a game or match. 
2) Parlay bets - parlays are a type of bet where you combine two or more bets into one, and if all of them win then you win a higher payout. 
3) Teaser bets - teasers are similar to parlays, but they offer less favorable odds in exchange for giving you more flexibility in your predictions. For example, you might be able to move the point spread in your favor or add points to the totals. 
4) Futures bets - futures bets are placed on events that have not yet taken place, such as who will win the World Cup or the Super Bowl. 
5) Prop (or proposition) bets - prop bets are any type of bet that falls outside of the normal match-ups and outcomes offered by bookmakers. These can include things like whether or not a player will score first, how many cards will be shown in a game, or how many corners will be taken. 

Yes Bet 88 also offers live betting which allows customers to place wagers on games as they're happening. This can be extremely lucrative if done correctly as it provides an opportunity to capitalize on late changes in the odds or unexpected results.
