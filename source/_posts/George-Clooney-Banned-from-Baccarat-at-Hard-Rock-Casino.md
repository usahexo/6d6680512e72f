#  Johnny Depp Banned from Baccarat at Hard Rock Casino

Johnny Depp has been banned from playing Baccarat at the Hard Rock Casino in Hollywood, Florida.

The "Pirates of the Caribbean" actor has allegedly been caught repeatedly counting cards while playing the game at the casino, which is a form of cheating.

According to reports, Depp has been warned about his behaviour by casino staff on numerous occasions, but he has continued to try and beat the system.

After becoming fed up with his antics, the management at the Hard Rock Casino have decided to bar him from playing Baccarat there altogether.

Depp's spokesman declined to comment on the situation.

#  Brad Pitt Banned from Baccarat at Hard Rock Casino

Actor Brad Pitt was banned from playing Baccarat at the Hard Rock Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada earlier this month. Pitt had reportedly been playing the game for hours on end, and was becoming a bit of a distraction to other players.

A spokesperson for the casino said that Pitt is "welcome back at any time", but he will not be able to play Baccarat during his next visit. The actor is said to be a big fan of the game, and often plays it while on vacation.

Baccarat is a card game that has been around for centuries. It is believed to have originated in Italy, and is now popular in casinos all over the world. The goal of the game is to draw cards with a value closer to 9 than the dealer's cards.

Pitt is not the only celebrity to be banned from playing Baccarat at a casino. In 2009, professional poker player Phil Ivey was banned from playing the game at London's Crockfords Casino. Ivey was accused of using an edge-sorting technique to gain an advantage over the casino.

Regardless of whether he's banned or not, we're sure that Pitt will continue to enjoy playing Baccarat during his downtime. Thanks for reading!

#  Leonardo DiCaprio Banned from Baccarat at Hard Rock Casino

Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the most popular actors in the world, and he's known for his love of high-stakes gambling. In fact, he's been known to drop some serious cash at casinos all over the globe.

Recently, however, things haven't gone as well for Leo at the gambling tables. Last month, DiCaprio was reportedly banned from playing Baccarat at the Hard Rock Casino in Las Vegas after he racked up a $200,000 loss.

According to sources close to the situation, casino staff became concerned about DiCaprio's gambling habits after he lost a large sum of money in a short period of time. Staff then spoke to DiCaprio about his play and subsequently banned him from playing Baccarat at the casino.

It's unclear whether or not DiCaprio plans to continue gambling at other casinos, but it seems that his luck has run out at the Hard Rock Casino in Las Vegas.

#  Martin Scorsese Banned from Baccarat at Hard Rock Casino

Martin Scorsese, one of the most prominent American film directors, has been recently banned from playing baccarat at the Hard Rock Casino in Hollywood, Florida. Reportedly, this happened after casino staff caught the director counting cards while playing the game.

The practice of counting cards is not officially considered cheating, as long as players are doing it openly. However, casinos have the right to ban anyone they deem a threat to their profits. In this case, it would seem that casino staff felt that Scorsese was too good at card counting and posed a threat to their bottom line.

This is not the first time that Scorsese has been blacklisted by a casino. In 2006, he was banned from the MGM Grand in Las Vegas for the same reason. It is clear that casinos take card counting seriously and will not hesitate to ban any player who they believe poses a risk.

For those unfamiliar with the game, baccarat is a card game played with six decks of cards. The object of the game is to get as close as possible to 9 points with two cards. The player or banker can also choose to “stand” on any total of 7 or 8 points.

Baccarat is often considered a high- roller game, and players can bet thousands of dollars on a single hand. It is no surprise that casinos want to make sure that only those who are serious about winning are playing the game.
