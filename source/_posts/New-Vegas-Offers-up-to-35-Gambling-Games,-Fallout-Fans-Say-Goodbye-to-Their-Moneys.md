#  New Vegas Offers up to 35 Gambling Games, Fallout Fans Say Goodbye to Their Moneys

Fallout fans were dealt a major financial blow this week with the announcement of Fallout New Vegas’ lineup of casino games. Reportedly, the game will feature up to 35 different gambling games, including slots, poker, blackjack and roulette.

“I can’t believe they’re taking this away from us,” said long-time Fallout fan Tim Walters. Walters has been playing the Fallout series since its debut in 1997 and has spent hundreds of dollars on in-game gambling. “This is just unfair.”

Walters is not alone in his criticism of Bethesda Softworks’ latest offering. Many Fallout fans have taken to social media to express their disappointment, with many vowing never to purchase the game.

Bethesda Softworks has yet to comment on the backlash, but has remained steadfast in its decision to include casino games in Fallout New Vegas. The company is no stranger to controversy; its previous title, Fallout 4, was met with criticism for its inclusion of paid mods.

The decision to include casino games in a major release such as Fallout New Vegas is puzzling, especially given the current political landscape around gambling addiction. With concerns about loot boxes and microtransactions reaching a fever pitch, it seems like an odd time to add such potentially addictive gameplay elements to a marquee title.
