#  How to Play Blackjack in Maldives – A Guide for Tourists 

Are you planning a trip to the Maldives and looking for something fun to do? Why not try your hand at blackjack? While the game is popular in many parts of the world, it can be a little confusing for first-time players. That’s why we’ve put together this guide to help you get started.

The basics of blackjack are simple: you are trying to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over. You can either hit (take another card) or stand (keep the cards you have). Doubling down means doubling your bet and then receiving one more card. Splitting means splitting a hand of two cards of the same rank into two separate hands, each with its own bet. A blackjack is when you get an Ace and a 10 or face card, giving you 21 points in total.

Most casinos in the Maldives will use six decks of cards for their games. The Dealer will always draw on 16 and stand on 17. In order to win, your hand must be higher than the Dealer’s hand without going over 21. If both hands are equal, it is called a ‘push’ and you neither win nor lose money.

Here are a few basic tips for playing blackjack in the Maldives: 
-Don’t go over 21 – if you do, you automatically lose
-Start with smaller bets until you know the game better 
-When in doubt, always hit (unless you think you might go over 21 if you take another card) 
-Remember that the Dealer must draw on 16 and stand on 17 
-If you split a hand, be sure to bet equally on each one 
-If you double down, make sure your bet is at least double what it was before
