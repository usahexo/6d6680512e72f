#  Gambling addiction: My story

I'm not sure when or how it started, but at some point in my life I developed a gambling addiction. It was like a demon that I couldn't shake and it controlled every aspect of my life.

Every day I would wake up thinking about gambling and I would spend hours online or at the casino trying to make money. The more I lost, the worse things got. I would borrow money from friends and family, lie to them about where I was going, and even steal just to get more money to gamble with.

I didn't care about anything else in life anymore - only the next bet. My relationships suffered, my work performance declined, and I was completely miserable. But I couldn't stop - the addiction had taken over me completely.

It wasn't until things got really bad that I decided to get help. I went to see a counsellor who helped me deal with my addiction and start on the road to recovery. Nowadays, I'm still on that road but I'm determined to stay clean.

If you're struggling with a gambling addiction, know that you're not alone and there is help available. Don't be afraid to ask for help - it's the first step on the road to recovery.
